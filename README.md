        1 - Task          
            
            There are 3 images provided to you. The big one is a Star Map, small ones are cropped images from the Star Map.
            
            One of the small one is horizontally and vertically matching with the Star Map, another one is rotated.
            
            1. One of the small images
            2. The Star Map


            The program should output 4 point positions in the Star Map, each corresponding to small imagesâ€™ corner points.
